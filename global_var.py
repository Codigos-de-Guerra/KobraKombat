## Just to use the same value of a variable in more than just one file;
## That way, will only need to change value here

SIZE = 500 # Size of game board, in pixels
ROWS = 20 # How many rows the playable game will have
DELAY = 50 # Delay time for the game execution, in milliseconds
TICK = 10 # Essentially, it's how many frames per second the game will update
